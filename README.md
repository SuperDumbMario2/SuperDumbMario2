- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SuperDumbMario2
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in SM64 Machinima, Mario romhacks, Nintendo console homebrews and Miiverse clones.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make SM64 Machinima, Mario romhacks and homebrews, as well as the PHP language.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: discord is "superdumbmario2"
- âš¡ Fun fact: I only do procedural PHP. I don't do OOP.
